HarvestX - MovieLens Project

In this report, a movie recommendation system will be built based on selected training sets of the MovieLens data set. 10M version of the MovieLens data set are extracted from GroupLens which is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Four algorithms will be applied: Simple Model without any affects, Movie Effects, Movie & User Effects and Regularization with Movie & User Effects. The result will be compared and analysed by the performance of Residual Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
